This analysis was to gain knowledge in data manipulation within pandas and python plotting tools. 

The original dataset is from: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data

This notebook also scraps missing data points from the original source through the api. 
For the scrapping to function a file must be created named  "themoviedb_apikey.txt" containing the string for the key. An example is show in "themoviedb_apikey_example.txt"
